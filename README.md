# Portfolio Project with Next.js and Sanity
This is a project aimed at showcasing my portfolio and integrating with a headless CMS (Sanity). It is built using Next.js.

## Getting Started
To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the result. 

## Integration with Sanity CMS
This project is designed to seamlessly integrate with the Sanity headless CMS. You can manage and update content through Sanity, and it will be dynamically fetched and displayed on the portfolio website.
